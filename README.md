Software Developer and Data Analyst
-----------------------------------

I've been working with computers for more than 20 years. I focused my last 15 years in helping nonprofits in their digital adventure. I focused my work in database design and improving all type of internal processes.

*   🌍  I'm based in the Canary Islands.
*   ✉️  You can contact me at [carlos.capote@hawara.es.](mailto:carlos.capote@hawara.es.)
*   🧠  I'm learning how to use machine learning for good, although I still keep studying things that help me working better for the organizations I collaborate with: like domain driven design, software architectural principles, frontend development, etc.

Latest Lessons and Experiments
------------------------------

You can have a glimpse of what I'm studying by checking:

>  **[Regresa](https://github.com/elcapo/regresa)** is a Python package where I implemented my own versions of the linear and logistic regression algorithms presented by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org) in his course: [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction).

>  **[Hello World](https://github.com/elcapo/hello_world)** contains a few basic neural network examples inspired while I was following [Laurence Moroney](lmoroney)'s [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/info) course in Coursera.

>  **[Experimental Layers](https://github.com/elcapo/experimental_layers)** is a natural continuation of the questions that I found while playing with the Hello World networks, where I experiment with tools to help neural networks to understand non periodic functions.

> **[Spanish Wiktionary Parser](https://github.com/elcapo/eswiktionary_parser)** is a simple one-purpose parser that transforms Spanish Wiktionary dump files into easier to read and process `csv` files. This parser was used to create the following HuggingFace dataset: [carloscapote/es.wiktionary.org](https://huggingface.co/datasets/carloscapote/es.wiktionary.org).

> **[Exprimidora](https://github.com/elcapo/exprimidora)** is a Spanish verb conjugator written to simplify the Wiktionary exports, as it contains more conjugations than actual definitions.
