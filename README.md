Software Developer and Data Analyst
-----------------------------------

I've been working with computers for more than 20 years. I focused my last 15 years in helping nonprofits in their digital adventure. I focused my work in database design and improving all type of internal processes.

*   🌍  I'm based in the Canary Islands.
*   ✉️  You can contact me at [carlos.capote@hawara.es.](mailto:carlos.capote@hawara.es.)
*   🧠  I'm learning how to use machine learning for good, although I still keep studying things that help me working better for the organizations I collaborate with: like domain driven design, software architectural principles, frontend development, etc.
