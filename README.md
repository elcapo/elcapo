Hi! My name is Carlos Capote
===========================================================================================================================================

Software Developer and Data Analyst
-----------------------------------

I've been working with computers for more than 20 years. I focused my last 15 years in helping nonprofits in their digital adventure. I focused my work in database design and improving all type of internal processes.

*   🌍  I'm based in the Canary Islands.
*   ✉️  You can contact me at [carlos.capote@hawara.es.](mailto:carlos.capote@hawara.es.)
*   🧠  I'm learning how to use machine learning for good, although I still keep studying things that help me working better for the organizations I collaborate with: like domain driven design, software architectural principles, frontend development, etc.

PHP Works
---------

> **[Guagua](https://github.com/hawara-es/guagua)** is a PHP implementation of a command, query and event buses. It's a package intended to showcase the buses needed for a standard CQRS application.

> **[Criba](https://github.com/hawara-es/criba)** is an implementation of the criteria pattern in PHP. It features an Eloquent implementation that facilitates using it the repositories of an application writen under the Domain Driven Design principles.

The **Guagua** and **Criba** packages exist for pedagogical purposes and they are not intended for production usage.

> **[Spanish VAT Numbers](https://github.com/hawara-es/spanish-vat-numbers)** is a very simple PHP library that provides validations for Spanish VAT numbers (NIF, NIE and CIF). It does not have production dependencies, what makes it lightweight and suitable for many production use cases.

Python Lessons and Experiments
------------------------------

You can have a glimpse of what I'm studying by checking:

>  **[Regresa](https://github.com/elcapo/regresa)** is a Python package where I implemented my own versions of the linear and logistic regression algorithms presented by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org) in his course: [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction).

>  **[Hello World](https://github.com/elcapo/hello_world)** contains a few basic neural network examples inspired while I was following [Laurence Moroney](lmoroney)'s [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/info) course in Coursera.

>  **[Experimental Layers](https://github.com/elcapo/experimental_layers)** is a natural continuation of the questions that I found while playing with the Hello World networks, where I experiment with tools to help neural networks to understand non periodic functions.

> **[Spanish Wiktionary Parser](https://github.com/elcapo/eswiktionary_parser)** is a simple one-purpose parser that transforms Spanish Wiktionary dump files into easier to read and process `csv` files. This parser was used to create the [carloscapote/es.wiktionary.org](https://huggingface.co/datasets/carloscapote/es.wiktionary.org) HuggingFace dataset.

> **[Exprimidora](https://github.com/elcapo/exprimidora)** is a Spanish verb conjugator written to simplify the Wiktionary exports, as it contains more conjugations than actual definitions.
